The same study found that 82 percent of the small businesses plan to accept some form of digital option in 2022. Also, 73 percent see that accepting new forms of payments is fundamental to their business growth. Visa also expanded its poll to include consumers which consisted of 1,000 adults from the United States and 500 respondents from each of the other eight participating countries. The response from consumers who expect to use crypto payments this year was much higher with 46 percent. While the Visa survey found that small businesses are planning to adopt a new form of digital payment in 2022, several other multinational companies also seem to be embracing digital currency.
